DCPU-16 Studio
==============

   DCPU-16 Studio is a graphical assembler, disassembler, emulator and
 debugger for the virtual computers in Mojang's upcoming new game 0x10^c.
 The program was written in FreePascal, Lazarus and uses the SynEdit editor
 component.  It features an editor with syntax highlighting, stepping
 through code, watching memory and registers (including which registers
 were modified after every step), a disassembly window and a few other
 minor features.
