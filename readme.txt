1. About
--------

   DCPU-16 Studio is a graphical assembler, disassembler, emulator and
 debugger for the virtual computers in Mojang's upcoming new game 0x10^c.
 The program was written in FreePascal, Lazarus and uses the SynEdit editor
 component.  It features an editor with syntax highlighting, stepping
 through code, watching memory and registers (including which registers
 were modified after every step), a disassembly window and a few other
 minor features.


2. A note on Ubuntu's Unity interface
-------------------------------------

   The Unity interface of Ubuntu and specifically the new "pop up" scroll
 bars interfere badly with parts of the program.  You need to either
 disable the pop up scroll bars globally or run the program like this:

    LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 ./dcpustud
